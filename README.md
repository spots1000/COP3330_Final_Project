# COP3330 Final Project

Objectives:
- Develop a GUI application in Java using WindowBuilder and Swing.
- Develop a program that assesses how quickly a user can complete a given math operation.
- Use JFrames to design a multi-page user interface that moves the user through a sequence of math operations.
- Display a score, ranked list, and problem history for the user after program completion.

Program Summary: The program will ask the user for name and other input parameters, generate a set of random arithmetic operations for the user to solve, and then generate a score and rank for the user after they have completed the requisite problems.
